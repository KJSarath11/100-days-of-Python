#scope
-local scope and global scope
-variable inside a function considered as a local scope since only the function 
 is able to access it
-global variable can be accessed by any part of the program. It is available throughout
 the life cycle of  the application or script in which it was declared.
-Python there is "no block scope". Inside a if/else/for/while code block is the same as outside it.
-"Name error" occurs when trying to print a variable that is local to a_function() and is only available inside the function.
